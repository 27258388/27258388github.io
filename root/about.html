			<p class="bout"> So you decided to visit the about section bold choice after this you're probably wondering what you're going to find here maybe I’ll tell you about my hats maybe I’ll tell you about my skills when it comes to creating and designing websites, who can say bet you wish for a full stop huh... too bad how many times have you left your cursor over the text and had to move to keep reading, You should take a minute to think about that out, but the real question I have  is how much time you wasted reading this and how much time have you spent looking at those hats?</p>

			<p class="bout"> That first section seemed rather empty. Who could help it really, your first thought may be that I could change it around to fill it more but why would I do that? You may think to populate this with more content but, is it not nice to have a short section talking about hats then a long drawn out one you're welcome for that by the way. Aside for a love of head ware I suppose I should mention something about myself, and if that was to be anything it would be that I am a straight to the point when it comes to talking about any point be that in person or through text.</p>

			<p class="bout"> Did you like the switch up. I'm going to have to apologize about how passive aggressive that was, but glad to see you decided to stay. So this is where you would think I tell you about my skills where it comes to creating websites for example using html, css3 or using tools like the adobe suite but I would rather show you. So why don’t you go and have a look at the showcase page I'll convince you and then you'll have a look at contact to get in touch with me.</p>
